# ‚≠êÔ∏è A* Pathfinding Visualization

This project visualizes the A* Pathfinding Algorithm using Python and Pygame. The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm used in various applications like games, maps, and robotics to find the shortest path between two points.

## üîç Project Overview

- **Language**: Python
- **Library**: Pygame for graphical visualization
- **Algorithm**: A* (A-star) Pathfinding

## üñ±Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Left-Click** to set the start point, end point, and barriers.
2. **Right-Click** to remove barriers or reset the start/end points.
3. Press **Spacebar** to start the A* algorithm and visualize the path.
4. Press **C** to clear the grid and start over.

## üíª Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TomStevenson1/A-Star-Algo-Visualizer-.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
